# FAQs

If you have any questions for the OSIRIS team or the community, you are welcome to ask them on Github. Frequently asked questions are listed here.

[Click here for the Q&A page!](https://github.com/OSIRIS-Solutions/osiris/discussions/categories/q-a){ .md-button }

??? question "I review the same publication several times as part of the same review process (after changes by the authors). Do I enter this several times in OSIRIS?"
     Yes, each review is entered individually: always for the same journal, but on different dates. The date on which the review was completed must always be entered.

??? question "I was corresponding author in a publication, but I was neither first nor last author. Do I get more coins than usual?"
     Yes, a corresponding author is counted as a last author. This role can only be specified separately in the author editor. If the corresponding author was also the first or last author, this role cannot and does not have to be filled in. You can find more information on this [here](/users/content/create_content/#add-authors).

??? question "I want to enter a publication/review, but OSIRIS cannot find the journal. What do I do now?"
    The data on journals is retrieved from OSIRIS itself and then from the [NLM catalogue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals/). If the journal is not found, there are two options: You are using an alternative spelling that NLM does not recognise, or the journal is not listed in the NLM catalogue. To remedy this, you can simply use the [ISSN](https://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/what-is-an-issn/) to search. It is a unique code for the journal and should be found somewhere (usually in the footer) on the journal's website.  
    If you still cannot find the journal, check again whether it has an impact factor and whether it is listed in the [Web of Science JCR](https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-funding-analytics/journal-citation-reports/). If this is not the case, the journal cannot be added to OSIRIS.  
    Alternatively, you can enter your publication as a magazine article (non-refereed), but it will not be categorised as a peer review, as it must be an indexed journal. The same applies to your reviews: You would have to enter these under "other activity" and leave a note in which you mention that it is a journal not listed in NML.

??? question "Where does OSIRIS get the impact factors from?"
    OSIRIS obtains its data from [SJR](https://www.scimagojr.com/), the SCImago Journal Rank, which in turn is formed from the Scopus database of Elsevier. These differ slightly from the impact factors of Clarivate (Web of Science). This is because citations are weighted according to the "importance" of the journals from which they originate, "so that citations from more important journals are more valuable than citations from less important journals". You can read more in this [publication](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0912/0912.4141.pdf).

??? question "The name under which I have published does not match the name in my OSIRIS profile. What do I do now?"
    In OSIRIS you have the option of entering several variations of your name for author matching. You can find more information about this [here](/users/profile/start/#personal).

??? question "Can I transfer the maintenance of my profile to another person?"
    Yes, you can. More information about this [here](/users/profile/start/#account). Be aware that this person can access all your private details and settings and make changes.  


??? question "How can I give administrator rights to another person?"
    If you want to give admin rights to another person as an administrator, you must go to the person's profile page and then to **Edit profile &#8594 Account**. Here you can also select **Admin** under **Roles**. You can find more information about this [here](/admins/roles/#give-role-to-users).
