# About OSIRIS

**OSIRIS** is an open, smart and intuitive research information system (RIS) that has been specially developed for smaller institutes, scientific institutions and research-related organisations. 

The system supports the **recording, management and evaluation of research activities** such as publications, third-party funded projects, lectures, software and courses. The focus is on ease of use, high flexibility and complete transparency.

## Our goals

- **Openness**: OSIRIS is open source and available free of charge – no licence fees, no lock-in.
- **User-friendliness**: The system is deliberately kept simple. Researchers and administrators can navigate it intuitively.
- **Adaptability**: Every institution is different – that's why OSIRIS can be adapted to individual needs without the need for programming.
- **Traceability**: Research achievements should not only be recorded, but also made visible and analysable.
## Who is behind it?

OSIRIS was developed by Julia and Dominic Koblitz in close collaboration between reporting and research and is continuously being further developed by OSIRIS Solutions GmbH and our community – with a focus on **real-world requirements**.
