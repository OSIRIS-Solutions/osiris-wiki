# Research trips

Research trips or stays can be recorded in OSIRIS as a normal activity. However, a separate module is available for their evaluation. Here you will find a brief explanation and a few tips on how to use it.

## Initialise the module

You can either create a completely new category or assign this new type to an existing category. It is only important that you assign the ID 'travel' to the type. If you have already created a type to track your research trips, you can also change the ID afterwards.

You can freely choose the **name of the activity**. Whether you call it research trips, stays abroad or field research is entirely up to you. The name you choose here will be used for the page navigation and as a heading for the evaluation.  

The type must also contain the following data fields:

- An **author field**. As you probably know, all activities in OSIRIS must always have an author in order to be assigned to persons. You can choose between several fields here, depending on whether you want to assign one or more persons. With the 'scientist' field you can select a single person from the institute, with 'authors' you can select several and with 'authors-table' you have full control. They all work for the research trip module.
- A **date field**. This is also mandatory. As research trips usually cover a period of time, I recommend the 'date-range' field.
- A **country field**. Here you can use either 'country' or 'countries', depending on whether you want to travel to one or more countries.
- The **status**. Here you can indicate whether the trip is completed, cancelled, in preparation or ongoing. The 'status' field is required.

You can of course add as many other fields as you like. Perhaps a location, research areas or a cost centre for billing. It's entirely up to you.

As soon as you have all these fields together, you can activate the **module**. To do this, go to the general settings in the admin area and navigate to the 'Functions' tab. There you will find the option to activate the "Research trips" module. As soon as it is correctly ticked and saved, you can get started straight away. In the Visualisation section, you should now see a new link with a map icon that has the same name as your activity type.
