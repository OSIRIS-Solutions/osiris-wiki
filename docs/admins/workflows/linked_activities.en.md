# Add workflows to activity categories

You can now apply your newly created workflow to one or more activity categories. To do this, you need to edit the category. To do this, go to **Content &#8594 Activities** in the admin menu and select your desired category.

To be able to apply the workflow to activities, you must edit the category and select the corresponding workflow via a drop-down menu

Under **Quality workflow** you can select one of the existing workflows. After you have saved, this workflow is automatically applied to **all newly created activities** in this category.

## Migration of existing activities

You can set the application of your workflow to existing activities in the category under **Content &#8594 Quality workflows**. To do this, select your workflow. In the lower area, you will find the list of linked activity categories. If you click on the arrow on the right, a widget will open.

The window shows you the number of activities found that belong to the selected category and how many of them are already equipped with the workflow. The mode cannot currently be changed and only attaches missing activities to the workflow. You can also set a filter here and specify, for example, that only publications from the last six months should be taken into account. Before you apply the workflow to all activities, you can also do a **dry run** here and count how many entries this would affect. If you are sure, you can carry out the migration, OSIRIS will show you a green box when everything has worked.
