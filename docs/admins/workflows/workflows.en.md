# Quality workflows

<!-- md:version 1.6.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

With the workflow function, you can now also map entire inspection and approval processes in OSIRIS. Workflows can be configured flexibly, assigned to several activity types and also applied to existing data.  

You can activate the feature under **Settings &#8594 Functions**. Remember to save the change so that OSIRIS can activate the function. The new menu item **Quality workflows** appears in the **Content** area.  

## Authorisations

To create a workflow, you need access to the administrator menu. Under [Roles and rights](/admins/roles/) you can determine which roles have access to the admin area. However, you can also determine here which roles can view the workflow status or even reset it without having direct access to the admin area. The latter right in particular should only be assigned very selectively, as it can be used to reset the entire review process of an activity. The current status of a workflow is always visible for your own activities. The right enables the status of **all** activities to be viewed.
