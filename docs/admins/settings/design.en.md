# Design settings

<!-- md:version 1.8.0 -->

With update 1.8.0, OSIRIS gives you the ability to customize the appearance even more precisely to match your corporate identity.

## Colors

Under **Colors**, you can choose a primary and a secondary color that match your institute. The primary color is used for the main elements, and the secondary color is used for highlighted elements of the website.

## Typography

With this feature, you can define custom fonts for both headings and regular body text.

In the **Font** dropdown menu, you will also find a small selection of predefined fonts.

## Display of elements

Here, you can customize various elements within OSIRIS.

Boxes in OSIRIS without a border, with a normal border, and with a thick border.

Boxes can be customized in terms of border thickness, border color, and corner radius. You can also add a shadow behind the box.

Links can be highlighted with an underline, and tables can be displayed with striped rows.

![Icons](screenshots/icons.png)

You can also customize the icons — original style, filled, or two-tone.

In addition to icons, you can customize the header and display the OSIRIS logo in different colors.

Using the *Navbar Height* option, you can adjust the height of the top navigation bar that contains the logos. If “No Navbar” is selected, the logos will be moved to the footer.
