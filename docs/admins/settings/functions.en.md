# Optional Features

In the admin area, under Settings &#8594 Features, you can manage the variety of optional features in OSIRIS and either activate or deactivate them. The features are displayed in the menu on the left accordingly. Please note that no rights are assigned to these features by default. You must assign these accordingly in the admin area under &#8594 Roles and Rights.

Here you will find a list of all available features:

??? note "[OSIRIS Portfolio](https://wiki.osiris-app.de/topics/portfolio/)"
    The OSIRIS portfolio is a publicly accessible website that showcases your institute's research activities. When you activate the portfolio here, you can manage the visibility settings for user profiles, activities, and more. In addition, the portfolio API is activated, which only provides the selected information.

??? note "[Projects&Proposals](/admins/content/projects/)"
    OSIRIS can manage complete project lifecycles, from proposal submission to project reporting. By activating this function, you can create and manage projects and proposals within OSIRIS. It is possible to define your own project types and manage data fields.

??? note "[Nagoya Protocol Compliance](https://wiki.osiris-app.de/topics/nagoya/)"
    The Nagoya Protocol is an international agreement that aims to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. OSIRIS can be configured to ensure compliance with the Nagoya Protocol.

??? note "[Teaching modules](/users/courses/)"
    It is possible to centrally manage teaching modules (e.g. at universities) and add them to activities, such as lectures or seminars. By enabling this feature, you can create and manage teaching modules within OSIRIS. To use teaching modules within activities, use the teaching module datafield. 

??? note "[Research Topics](https://wiki.osiris-app.de/users/topics/)"
     Research topics can be used in OSIRIS to define the thematic focus of scientific research conducted by researchers or research groups. As an administrator, you can change the term *research topics* here and adapt it to your needs.

??? note "[Infrastructures](https://wiki.osiris-app.de/users/infrastructures/)"
     Research infrastructures are central resources such as equipment, facilities, data, libraries, or virtual platforms. As an administrator, you can change the term *research areas* here and adapt it to your needs.

??? note "[Events](https://wiki.osiris-app.de/users/events/)"
    The Events function can be used to document conferences, meetings, or similar events in OSIRIS and link them to people and activities.

??? note "[Quarterly reporting](/users/reporting/quarterly-reporting/)"
    OSIRIS reminds users every three months to update their activities and submit them for reporting. The controlling dashboard then provides an overview of all those who have not yet updated their data. 

??? note "[Quality workflows](https://wiki.osiris-app.de/admins/workflows/workflows/)"
    You can enable a quality workflow for activities. This means that users can submit their activities for review, and an admin or editor can then approve or reject them.
