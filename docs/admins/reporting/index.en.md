# Reporting

The basic aim of OSIRIS is to facilitate regular reporting of all kinds and to record research activities at the institute in a regular and standardised manner. Since different types of reports are generated at an institute, individual **report templates** can be created in OSIRIS. In addition, OSIRIS automatically creates **statistics** and associated visualisations of the activities at the institute, which can be inserted into a report. **Quarterly reports** are one of the most common reports at institutes. To facilitate this, OSIRIS automatically prompts users to review and approve their activities at the end of each quarter. However, you can also switch off this function under Settings &#8594 Functions.  

As the editing of report templates in the specified settings in OSIRIS is also possible by editors, you can find the chapter and explanations on statistics and quarterly reports [here](/users/reporting/).  

If you want only the administration to be able to edit report templates, you can set the rights for this under **Roles and rights**.
