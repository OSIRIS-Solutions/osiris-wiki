# Manage personal data

On the Manage content &#8594 People page, you can make all settings relating to personal data.  

Under **General** you can activate the gamification of OSIRIS so that *Achievements* and *Coins* are visible, as well as switch on the metrics in the user profile and determine where the user's profile pictures are saved.

Authentication** allows you to set whether new users can create their own account independently.

Under **Data fields** you can set the fields that can be displayed and filled in on a user profile. Further down you will find customised fields, if available.

The **Positions** page allows you to predefine a list of possible positions for the college. If you select this option, users can select an option from this list in their profile under &#8594 Organisation for *Current position*. With free text, users can enter positions themselves.

Under **Key words** you can define a list of words that users can use in their profile under &#8594 Research to describe their activities. You must activate this function under &#8594 Data fields by ticking the box for *key words*.
