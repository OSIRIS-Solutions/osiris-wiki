# Manage content

OSIRIS comes with default settings that allow direct use of the system and can be used to document research activities. As research and therefore the needs of institutions differ greatly, the content can be configured down to the smallest detail in the admin area. You can customise the templates for **activities**, add new ones, create **project** forms and change details for the display of **personal data**. Are you missing information fields or specific formulations for these activities? Then you can also create **user-defined fields** here and expand the **vocabulary** used in OSIRIS.
