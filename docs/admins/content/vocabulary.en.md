# edit vocabulary

On the **Vocabulary** page you will find a list of the words, or here also called values, that are used in the various dropdown menus in OSIRIS.

You can change the values so that users have other words to select from the drop-down menu.

![Event change](screenshots/vocabulary_event2.png)
///caption
Here, "international" has been replaced by "worldwide" in the vocabulary. The selection in the dropdown menu is adjusted accordingly
///

The value is changed for **all** events: Events that have already been created and for which international has been selected in the "Type" field now have the value "worldwide".

:exclamation: For technical reasons, it is not possible to delete values. However, you can deactivate them so that they are no longer displayed in the dropdown.

If you are missing words for a category, you can add new values. To do this, you must first create a unique ID that can no longer be changed; you can still change the values flexibly.  
You can change the order of the values in the drop-down menu by dragging and dropping them on the left-hand side.
