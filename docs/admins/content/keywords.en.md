# Indexing of entries

OSIRIS offers you the option of assigning keywords to projects, events and activities in order to better organise them thematically. This is an optional function and can be switched on in the admin area under **Settings &#8594 Functions &#8594 Tags**.  

In addition to these thematic keywords, OSIRIS also offers the option of creating personalised keywords. You can find more information on this [here](/admins/content/persons/).

If the function is switched on, you will find a **Tags** button in the admin panel under **Content &#8594 User-defined data**.
