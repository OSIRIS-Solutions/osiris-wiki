# User administration


!!! warning "Page under construction"
    This page is still under construction. We ask for your patience.


## Former employees at Altdaten

Former employees do not need to be created centrally in order to be available for legacy data. A user account is actually only important for people who log in centrally and need access to their profile. However, the assignment of an author to the institute is not done via the assignment to a user account, but via an affiliated flag, which is stored in the database as "aoi" for authors (affiliation of interest). If this is true, authors are assigned to the institute and highlighted in bold, even if no user account is linked.
