In the rights and roles, you can assign rights to reset a person's password. The "Reset password" function then appears in the extended list of functions for a user (with the three dots):

On the following page, you must then confirm once that you really want to reset the password.

You will then receive a link that you can pass on to the person who wants to reset their password. You can copy the link to the clipboard using a button.


!!! tip
    Please note that the link will not work if you are already logged in. You will be redirected to your personal profile page without any further comment. The link only works if you are not logged in.
