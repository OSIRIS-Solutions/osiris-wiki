# Important rights

This section explains the most important rights to be assigned in OSIRIS.

## Access admin panel

If this right is given to a role other than the Admin, the role can change all settings relating to the institution, the content, report templates and the roles and rights and can also delete some of them. This right should only be given to people who are very familiar with the system and are expected to make far-reaching changes.

## Delete blocked activity

Locked activities are those which, as documented in OSIRIS, have been used in a report, for example. If such an activity is deleted, it can no longer be found in the system and can no longer be traced. Blocked activities should therefore only be deleted by users who have an overview of the use of the entries.

## Assign admin rights

If this right is assigned to a role, it can appoint any user as an admin, who then has access to the admin panel with all its settings.

## Delete user

If a user is deleted, all account data is removed, including all affiliations and activities. In activities in which the profile has a co-authorship, the name is greyed out. This also applies to activities created by the deleted user. It is not possible to restore the account, the profile can no longer be found in the search. It is recommended to inactivate an account instead of deleting it.

## Inactivate user

Deactivating an account results in all information about this person being deleted from the database, except for the username and name. The account can no longer be found in the person search, but is still listed in activities and labelled with a reference to inactivation.
