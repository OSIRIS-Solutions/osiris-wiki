# Manage events

You can also use OSIRIS to manage and plan events such as conferences, meetings or other events. You can activate or deactivate the function under **Settings &#8594 Functions &#8594 Calendar and events**.

You can deactivate the **Events** function here if you do not want to use it

Under the **Activities** sub-item, you can assign the **Create and manage events** right to the roles so that certain people can create events in OSIRIS.

Further explanations on events can be found [here](/users/events/).
