# Links in the footer, imprint and data protection

<!-- md:version 1.5.0 -->

The links in the footer can be customised, as can the content of the legal notice and privacy policy, which are also linked in the footer. These settings are visible to all users and should therefore be carefully maintained in order to fulfil legal requirements and ensure clear communication.

These settings can be found under Settings → Content in the footer. There you can edit the legal notice and privacy policy and also add further links to the footer.

## Imprint

Here you can customise the content of the legal notice. The classic full text editor, which you already know from other pages and with which you can format the text, is supported. This content is then displayed when users click on the **Imprint** link in the footer.

## Data protection

Here you can customise the content of the privacy policy. The classic full text editor is also supported here to format the text. This content is displayed when users click on the **Privacy Policy** link in the footer.


## Footer links

You can add further links to the footer in the **Links** section. To do this, enter the link text in German and English as well as the URL in the OSIRIS settings. These links are then displayed in the footer. For example, you can add links to company agreements, your own documentation or other important pages here.
