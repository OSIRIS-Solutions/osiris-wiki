# Instructions for content administrators

OSIRIS is a research information system that can be used and administered at any institute without external help. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain a certain structure among the users in order to maintain and customise the system. OSIRIS has the role of admin for this purpose. This role should be taken on by one person - or several - who mainly manages OSIRIS and has a good overview of the needs of the various departments (e.g. Controlling, HR, Scientists). This is because only the Admin role can influence the rights of all other roles in OSIRIS, change the central settings, customise the layout and manage activity types and categories (as long as these rights are not given to another role).  
In the following sections you will find explanations of all the settings and configurations that can be made as an admin by default.
