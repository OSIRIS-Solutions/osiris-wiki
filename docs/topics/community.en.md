# The OSIRIS Community

OSIRIS is an open source project that thrives on a committed community. Not everyone has to be a developer to contribute to the community. There are many ways in which you can help, be it through feedback, ideas or active participation.

## Join in

### Have your say

You can actively participate in the further development of OSIRIS by giving feedback, contributing ideas or taking part in discussions. We welcome any input that makes OSIRIS better.

Our **Community Meeting** takes place every two months, where the developers give an insight into the latest developments and news and we discuss current topics. You can register for the meetings once and then receive regular invitations to the meetings.
