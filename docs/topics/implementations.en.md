    OSIRIS is open source software and as such it thrives on the community exchanging ideas and supporting each other. If you use OSIRIS or are in the process of introducing it, then get in touch with us! We look forward to every exchange and every feedback. You can also suggest changes directly via Github and add your institute to this page.
