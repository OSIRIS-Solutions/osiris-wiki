# Nagoya Protocol Compliance

<!-- md:version 1.7.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

The Nagoya Protocol is an international agreement that aims to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilisation of genetic resources. Compliance with the Nagoya Protocol is essential for organisations involved in the utilisation of genetic resources in order to avoid legal problems and promote sustainable practices.

OSIRIS can be configured to ensure compliance with the Nagoya Protocol. To do this, you must first enable the Nagoya Protocol module in the general settings of OSIRIS and grant the 'nagoya.view' permission to the roles associated with the ABS compliance officers.

You can find out exactly what the ABS compliance process in OSIRIS looks like in the following presentation: [OSIRIS and the Nagoya Protocol (PDF)](/assets/documents/OSIRIS-Nagoya-Module.pdf).
