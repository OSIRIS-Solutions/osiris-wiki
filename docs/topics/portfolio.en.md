# Portfolio


!!! warning "Page under construction"
    This page is still under construction. We ask for your patience.

## What is OSIRIS Portfolio?

OSIRIS Portfolio is an extension that allows you to present your research to the outside world. Portfolio offers separate pages for each of your organisational units, from the institute to the departments and groups to individual persons, who are given a beautiful profile page with Portfolio. All your achievements are presented, from publications and third-party funded projects to research activities.

## How Portfolio is structured

In the background, Portfolio accesses your OSIRIS instance, i.e. you display the information that you manage in OSIRIS. For security reasons, OSIRIS only delivers what should be visible to the outside world. In OSIRIS you can set directly what you want to see and what you do not want to see. Portfolio then only shows what you have authorised.

The **organisational units** of your institution are at the heart of OSIRIS. These are also mapped and maintained in OSIRIS. Portfolio shows the entire institution with all organisational units on the start page. Users can click through your organisational structure. Portfolio shows the associated persons, projects, publications and research activities, but research interests can also be maintained directly in OSIRIS. Here you can see a screenshot of OSIRIS Portfolio:

## Tailored to you

Portfolio is very flexible. You can configure the content yourself and, of course, customise the design to suit your requirements. Header and footer are completely interchangeable, simply insert the elements of your website here. Users will not notice that they have left your website.

The colours, font and design of Portfolio itself are also customisable.
