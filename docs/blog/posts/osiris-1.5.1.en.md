# 🚀 OSIRIS 1.5.1 is here!


This minor update focuses on the completely new form builder, a much better user experience for multi-select fields and many detailed improvements when working with publishers.

<!-- more -->

## 🧱 New form builder

With the new form builder you can design the forms for your activities according to your needs:

- Layout elements such as headings, separators and paragraphs
- Customised names for fields and new help texts
- Customisable field widths to create complex forms
- Built-in preview for fields and forms
- Forms can be copied from other types and used as templates
- In the editor for activity types, fields are now displayed as badges with icons - including a link to the new form builder

> This means that even complex form structures can be created clearly and without programming knowledge. Try it out, an introductory video will follow shortly on our new [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OSIRISsolutions)! 🎥


## ✅ More intuitive custom fields

Multi-select fields now offer a much better user experience: instead of pressing the
Ctrl' key, you can now simply select multiple options using a checkbox.
The display is clearer, takes up less space, is language-independent and works more reliably in all forms. Try it out and create [Custom Fields](/admins/content/custom-fields.md) with multiple selection.


## 🎓 New module for the supervision of theses

The previously included data field "supervisor" caused problems as it required the specification of semester hours per week. Although it is suitable for courses, it is not ideal for supervising theses. We have therefore developed a new data module specifically for theses (`supervisor-thesis`), which asks for the role of the supervisor instead of SWS. This means you can now manage and allocate theses even better.


## 👩‍💼 Improvements for publishers

Even after the last update, there were still a few problems with editors, which we have now fixed.

- Editors can now be edited correctly in the follow-up
- Editors are now correctly notified about new publications and can confirm them
- Editorships are taken into account for units and appear in the counts and analyses


## 🎨 Further UI/UX optimisations

- Better styling for grouped lists and forms
- Help texts appear contextually directly on the field
- Numerous minor improvements to AJAX, saving, display, etc.


## 🛠️ And many smaller improvements...

As always, the update contains many other detailed improvements that make OSIRIS more stable and enjoyable. You can find the complete list of all changes on GitHub:
