# A first look at Portfolio

In the [last post](osiris-portfolio.md) I already talked about our motivation and where the name *Portfolio* comes from. This time I would like to go into a little more detail about the features of OSIRIS Portfolio.

<!-- more -->

You start with an overview of the institute. Here you can see everything for the entire institute. On the left-hand side you have an overview of the organisational units within the institute. On the one hand, this serves as an overview (what departments are there?), on the other hand it also serves as navigation, but we will come to that in a moment. On the right-hand side you will find the actual information about the institute. At the top there are buttons that allow you to switch back and forth between the various pieces of information: only the information for which there is data is shown here. Once all the data has been entered, you have the following information here:

- Info (a description of the institute)
- Research (expandable information on research specialisations)
- Team (an overview of all people in the institute)
- Publications
- Activities (what is shown here can be configured)
- Projects (this mostly refers to third-party funded projects, but anything is possible)

![Overview of the institute: The person search](https://osiris-app.de/img/portfolio/overview_default.png)

If you now click through the departments and groups on the left-hand side, the data on the right-hand side will be filtered. You will then only see what belongs to the organisational unit you have just selected. You can click down to the lowest level of your organisation chart and then select individual people in the team. In addition to the pages for the individual organisational units, there are also profile pages for people, as well as detailed pages for activities and projects. **And everything in OSIRIS Portfolio is interlinked**.


> We chose this layout because we believe it provides the deepest insight into the structure and research of an institute. You can navigate through the site using the organisational structure and have the opportunity to learn more about what you have found and to click further and further.
>
> In OSIRIS you also have the option of writing texts in both German and English, as OSIRIS Portfolio also supports **bilingualism**.

## The profile page of the researchers

You can find different amounts of information on a person's profile page - depending on how many activities or similar are entered in OSIRIS and how much additional information the person has entered in their profile. Again, the following applies: sections are only shown if data is available. Personal data is specially protected. The profile picture must be explicitly released, email and telephone number can be hidden. An alternative email can be specified (e.g. "regarding services please contact services@institute.de") and the specification of social media accounts is voluntary. In principle, there can be the following sections:

- Affiliation to organisational units
- Contact information
- Research interests
- Curriculum Vitae
- Highlighted Research
- All publications of the person
- All other activities of the person (types according to the above configuration)
- Projects in which the person is involved (current and past)
- Teaching participation

## The detail page of activities and projects

If you click on an activity - either on the organisational units page, in the profile or under projects - you will find further information on the activity, such as a list of all authors, the associated departments and associated projects. Further down there are also various export and citation options, e.g. as a fully formatted citation, as BibTeX or in RIS format.

The project page, on the other hand, contains a description that can be written in OSIRIS in Markdown. For reference, this blog post is also written in Markdown and if you scroll back up you can see what a variety of formatting (including images) is possible with it. In addition to some interesting details such as duration and third-party funders, there is also a list of all associated research results (publications and more), an overview of the project team and an interactive map with all cooperation partners.
