# Community Meeting on 09.10.2025

Many thanks to everyone who took part in the community meeting and contributed to the interesting discussion!  
Here is a summary of the topics discussed.

## OSIRIS v1.6.0 *beta* in the starting blocks!

The latest version of OSIRIS brings you new features and improvements to existing functions.

### The new form builder

The new form builder allows you to customise the activity forms and set your own names for fields and help texts. You can find a more detailed explanation in the [Wiki](/admins/content/activities/#form-builder) and a tutorial on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1ZT2vlRFeA&t=13s).

### Tagging of activities

Until now, the administration could only define personal keywords. With the new function, this is also possible for activities, events and projects.

### Quality workflows

A frequently requested feature is now finally available: The quality workflows. You can use the workflows to map review and approval processes, track progress and apply them to new and existing activities. You can find instructions on how to use them [here](/admins/workflows/workflows/).

### Mail Digest

With the new Mail Digest function, your users can be regularly informed about notifications in OSIRIS by e-mail. Further information can be found [here](/admins/email/),

### Further innovations

- **Drafts for activities:** You can now save your entries via *Save as draft* without them being directly visible to everyone
- **Improved report templates:** The report editor has been further improved and now allows better formatting of text fields and setting of additional parameters
- Distribute roles centrally:** You can now assign roles to users directly and centrally using the *Distribute roles* button
- Conditional Templates:** By marking the template with the *%* sign, this part is only displayed if values are available.
- **"Other" in list via user-defined fields:** If you create a list as a user-defined field, it is now also possible to select the option *Other* in the list and specify individual values.

Furthermore, the creation of company agreements during the introduction of OSIRIS was discussed. There will soon be information on this in the wiki.  
Another topic was motivating employees to use OSIRIS and convincing them to use the system. Here, too, we want to support you in the future and provide ideas.  

Further details and changes can be found in the [presentation](/assets/documents/Community-251009.pdf).

:date: The next OSIRIS Community Event will take place on **10.12.2025 at 1pm**.
