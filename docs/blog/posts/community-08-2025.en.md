# Community Meeting on 13.08.2025

Thank you to everyone who attended the community meeting today! Here is the summary with the most important information, announcements and discussion points.

## The new Wiki

The new wiki of OSIRIS is still under construction and will be filled by Martinique in the future. You can reach it [here](mailto:martinique.frentrup@osiris-solutions.de).

## OSIRIS now uses build numbers

In order to better share smaller hotfixes and changes, OSIRIS now uses build numbers, which consist of the date of the change and the version number.

## OSIRIS Version 1.5.0 - What else is new?

In addition to the new features in OSIRIS v1.5.0 listed in the blog post from [31.07.2025](/blog/2025/07/31/osiris-version-150-is-now-available/), we have talked about other changes. A few of them are listed here:

- **author formatting** no longer has a hyphen and a comma-separated name variant has been added
- Users can now be **deleted**, but it is still recommended to select the function of inactivating users
- Research infrastructures**: Statistics can now be configured via the vocabulary
- Research trips**: Registered journeys now adopt the title of the corresponding activity

In addition, the evaluation of the committee survey was presented and planned developments were discussed.

Further details and changes can be found in the [presentation](/assets/documents/Community-250813.pdf).

:date: The next OSIRIS Community Event will take place on **09.10.2025 at 1pm**.
