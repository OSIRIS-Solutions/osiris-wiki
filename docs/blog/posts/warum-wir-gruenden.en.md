# Why we founded OSIRIS Solutions

It's a long story. Although, it's not actually that long. Actually, we were asked. We were asked again and again whether we wanted to found a company, whether we could offer support, whether we could host.

At first, we categorically refused. OSIRIS is open source software that should not be commercialised. Full stop. That was the statement. But on the other hand, there's no point if OSIRIS can't be used by any institution because, after all, it's specially designed for smaller institutes, which often only have a small (if any) IT department that often can't or doesn't want to deal with it.

The first thought was: let's set up an association. This takes up the community idea and gives the institutions the opportunity to participate and shape it. However, after careful consideration, an association brings with it a number of stumbling blocks. First of all, the statutes. General meetings, board elections, etc. And what if you want to employ someone if the work becomes too much? Phew. What seems like a plus at first is actually a pitfall: do the institutes want to be involved? Do they want to participate in an association structure? Would someone try to vote us off the board? Would the institutes have confidence in an association? There were so many questions to which we had no answers.

After the CRIS days of the Leibniz Association in September 2023, we were ready. We no longer completely ruled out founding a company and at least looked into the topic. Is it possible to found a company without becoming a selfish capitalist? Can you carry on the open source idea behind OSIRIS if you are a company? And what kind of company? UG, GmbH, UKG, and what are they all called? So many questions.

It quickly became clear that it should be a GmbH. There should be a broad portfolio of IT services, all focussed on OSIRIS for the time being - hence the name *OSIRIS Solutions*.  We want to support organisations on their journey to the perfect CRIS with fair and transparent prices. Nevertheless, the foundation itself took much longer than expected. The process was complicated and slow. Fortunately, we had a competent partner at hand in [Wirtschaftsregion Helmstedt], who advised and supported us during the process. A tax consultant was found, as was a notary. And then, on 16 May, the partnership agreement was finally signed.
