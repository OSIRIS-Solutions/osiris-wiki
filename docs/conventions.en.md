# Conventions

## Symbols

Some symbols are used in this documentation for illustrative purposes. Please familiarize yourself with the following list of conventions before proceeding:

### <!-- md:version --> - Version { data-toc-label="Version" }

The tag symbol in conjunction with a version number indicates when a particular feature or behavior was added. Make sure you use at least this version if you want to use it.

### <!-- md:feature --> - Optional feature { #feature data-toc-label="Optional feature" }

Some features are optional in OSIRIS and can be activated or deactivated as required. You can usually find these settings in the admin area under "Settings" > "Features".

### <!-- md:auth --> - User Management { data-toc-label="User Management" }
Some functions are only available if a certain type of user management (Auth, OAuth2 or LDAP) is used. These functions are labelled with the user symbol.


### <!-- md:beta --> - Beta { data-toc-label="Beta" }

Some newer features are still considered experimental, which means that they may change at any time (albeit rarely), including their complete removal (which has not happened yet).

### <!-- md:plugin --> - Plugin { data-toc-label="Plugin" }

There are a few features that are not included in OSIRIS by default, but are provided as plugins. These plugins are usually optional and can be installed as additional packages.
