# Infrastructures

<!-- md:version 1.4.1 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

Like projects, research infrastructures are a separate entity in OSIRIS that must be activated centrally. If you would like to maintain research infrastructures in OSIRIS, but this function is not yet activated, please contact your OSIRIS administrator. They can find the instructions for activation [here](/admins/content/infrastructures/).


!!! info "Note"
    We use the term "research infrastructures" here, but the administrator can customise this term in the settings. Therefore, you may see a different name in the OSIRIS interface instead. If you are unsure, look for an icon that looks like a transparent cube.

Research infrastructures are centralised resources such as equipment, facilities, data, libraries or virtual platforms that are made available to scientists to enable and facilitate research and promote innovation.
