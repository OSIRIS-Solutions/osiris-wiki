# E-Mail-Digest

<!-- md:version 1.6.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

With this new function, you can receive emails from OSIRIS at regular intervals informing you about pending activities, messages and possible updates. This function must be switched on centrally by the administration. An explanation can be found [here](/admins/email/#email-digest).

In your profile, you can decide for yourself how often you receive emails. To do this, go to **Edit profile** on your start page and then select **Contact**.

The mails contain the following information:

- Pending notifications for expired quarters (if relevant).
- open activities & issues,
- new messages,
- pending reviews,
- system news & updates (only if other notifications are also available).
