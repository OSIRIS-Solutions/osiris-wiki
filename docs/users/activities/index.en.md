If you select **All activities** in the menu on the left, you will see an overview of all entries in OSIRIS.

The **All activities** page with an overview of all entries in OSIRIS

This page offers you simple options for filtering the entries on the right. You can also use the top bar of the table to sort the entries by *Quarter*, *Type* or alphabetically by clicking on *Activity*. To export the table, you can choose between *Excel* and *csv* format, or simply *copy* the table.  

To create a more customised list of entries, you can use the [advanced search](/users/activities/advanced-search/).  

Next to each activity you will find an arrow that takes you to the [expanded view](/users/activities/expanded_view/) of the entry. If you want to create a list of entries for export without the advanced search, you can use the [shopping cart](/users/activities/cart/) icon to the right of the arrow.  

At the top left you will see the button that takes you to [Statistics](/users/reporting/statistics/). Here you can find various tables relating to the entries in a specific report period in OSIRIS.  

If you have the role of **Admin** or **Editor** or have been assigned the right to block activities, you will find the button for this directly next to the statistics button. If the button is not displayed, you have not been granted this right.
