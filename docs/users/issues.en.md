# Warnings and messages

There are various messages that you can receive as a user in OSIRIS. They show you where you need to take action. You can see whether you currently have a message by the bell symbol at the top right of your profile. With one click, you can see all messages in an extra window with a direct link to the respective pages.

## Verification of authorships

Sometimes other scientists or members of the institute add scientific activities in which you were also involved. The system tries to assign them automatically, which is why you will receive a message to confirm your authorship. Make sure that you really belong to the **activity** and that your **name is spelt correctly** and affiliated with the institute.  

The confirmation of the activity can be requested again if the activity has been changed by other people, be it correction of spelling mistakes or the deposit of a document.

There are five buttons below the question as to whether this is your activity:

- green tick: This allows you to confirm the activity if you were affiliated with the institute at the time
- Pin: This confirms that this is your activity, but that you were not affiliated with the institute at the time.
- Red cross: You reject the activity and thus the authorship
- Pen: Takes you to the page where you can edit the activity
- Arrow: Takes you to the extended view of the activity

## Online ahead of print

**Online ahead of print** means that the publication is already available online, but the actual publication in an issue is still pending. An example of this is the NAR Database Issue, where publications are already available online in September or October, although the issue is not published until the following January.

These publications cannot be included in the reports. They are included in OSIRIS so as not to lose sight of them and because they represent achievements that have already been made. In such cases, OSIRIS regularly asks whether the publication has now been published. Only then can it be included in the reporting.  

The **bibliographic data** must be checked again. The *Epub* box must be unchecked and the publication date is usually also adjusted. It can also happen that the bibliographic data itself changes, for example the page number. Therefore, please check carefully that all data is correct.

## Student degree

To ensure that final theses always have the correct status and completion date, OSIRIS issues a warning if these theses are still "in progress" even though the completion date is in the past.

Please check whether the thesis has already been completed. If this is the case, you can adjust the status accordingly and enter the end date. If the thesis is still "in progress", you can simply extend the date of the thesis. OSIRIS will ask you again in due course whether the thesis has been successfully completed.

## Release quarter

If this function has been activated by the administration, OSIRIS will ask you at the end of each quarter to check your activities and release the quarter for controlling. You can find more information about the quarterly reports [here](/users/reporting/quarterly-reporting/) and [here](/users/profile/scientist_view/).

## Activities without end date

If you are a member of **committees, editorial boards** or the like, OSIRIS will remind you every quarter that this activity exists and ask you for confirmation. If you click on **yes**, you will not be reminded of this activity until the next quarter. If you click on **no**, you will be redirected to the edit page of the activity where you can set the end date.
