# Quality workflows

<!-- md:version 1.6.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

Thanks to the workflow function, you will always be notified in your individual user role in OSIRIS when an action is required of you. Quality workflows can map entire inspection and approval processes and are managed by the administration.  
If an action or a check is required from you, this will be displayed in the menu on the left under **Reviews**. You can find more detailed explanations of the process [here](/admins/workflows/workflow_handling/).
