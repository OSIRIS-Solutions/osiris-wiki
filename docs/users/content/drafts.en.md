# Drafts

<!-- md:version 1.6.0 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

OSIRIS offers you the option of saving drafts for your entries. When you add a new activity, there is now a **Save as draft** button next to the *Save* button on the form.  
If the button is not displayed, please contact your administrator. They can activate the function.

If you save an activity as a draft, your co-authors will not be informed. You can therefore still make changes here at your leisure. Only when you save the draft as an activity will your co-authors be notified.  
You can find all your drafts at the top left of the **Add activity** page.

If you click on the button, all your drafts will be displayed.

Here you can either display your drafts or switch directly to the editor to complete your entry.
