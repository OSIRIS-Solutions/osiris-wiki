# Advanced functions

## Upload files

You can store important documents for each activity in OSIRIS. To do this, go to the [expanded view](/users/activities/expanded_view/) of the activity and click on **Upload file** to access the following widget:

///

If files have already been added to this activity, the button will be displayed as **files** with the number of documents stored. If you click on the button, the existing files are displayed. On the right is a button for uploading further files, which takes you to the widget.  
All uploaded documents are displayed under **All files**, which you can also download and delete here.  
Under **Add files** you can upload new documents by clicking on **Attach a file**. These must not exceed a maximum size of 16 MB and should be in a standard format if possible. Good examples are PDF (preferred), PPTX, XLSX, DOCX. Once you have selected the file, all you have to do is click on **Upload** to upload it.

## Editor comments

When an activity is edited, OSIRIS offers the possibility to leave a comment regarding the changes to all co-authors.

This field only appears if you are editing an existing activity. If you think that your changes are too minimal to require review by the co-authors, you can tick the appropriate box at the bottom.

When your co-authors are notified, they will receive a message showing your changes and your comment. In this message, they can confirm whether the assignment is correct, whether they were not yet affiliated when the activity took place, or even reject the authorship. With the pencil button you can edit the activity yourself, the arrow button leads to the extended view of the activity.

## Copy activity

OSIRIS offers you the option of creating copies for certain types of activities, allowing you to quickly create recurring activities with slight changes (e.g. date or event). Copying is possible for all activity types except publications.

This function is particularly useful if, for example, you are presenting talks or posters at several conferences. This way, you only have to adjust the date and/or location and do not have to create the activity from scratch.
