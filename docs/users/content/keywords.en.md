# Indexing of entries

To better categorise entries in OSIRIS and make them easier to find by topic, you can link activities, events and projects with keywords. This function must be switched on by the administration. The keywords are also specified by the administration. So if you are missing a word, please contact your admins. Further explanations can be found [here](/admins/content/keywords/).  

To add keywords to an **activity**, the administration must add the **keywords** data field to the form of the respective activity type via the [form builder](/admins/content/activities/#form-builder).

The Keywords data field appears as a drop-down menu in the activity form, from which the user can select any number of words. These are then listed in the completed activity view, separated by a comma.  

Under [All activities](/users/activities/) you can now also filter the activities according to these keywords.

You can also link **events** to keywords. When you add a new event, you will find the drop-down menu with the existing keywords under the research areas and can select several matching words. As with the activities, you can also filter by keywords here.

To link **projects** with keywords, the administration must add the *keywords* field to the various phases of the project. This is possible under **Contents &#8594 Projects**. The respective type of project can be selected and edited here. The selection of the optional fields can be found on the second page of the project settings.
