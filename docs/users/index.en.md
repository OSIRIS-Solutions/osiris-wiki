# Instructions for users

OSIRIS aims to facilitate your work in your individual role, be it documenting your research as a scientist, managing the college as a human resources department or creating reports for controlling. To this end, the system can be customised by the administration to suit your needs and offers different options for each role.  
The following sections explain functions in OSIRIS that may not be authorised for your role. This can be determined individually. Contact your administrator if you are missing functions.
