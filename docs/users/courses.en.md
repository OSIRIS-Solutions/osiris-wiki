# Courses

Under **Teaching modules** you can create modules that allow you to combine several activities of the type **Teaching**. Before you can add a teaching activity, the appropriate module must be created. If you cannot find the function in the left menu, it must be activated by your administration under Settings &#8594 Functions.

## Add teaching module

By default, each role can add a course in OSIRIS. To do this, select **Teaching modules** in the menu on the left and go to **Create new course**. The following widget appears:

Here you can enter the name, the module number, the institution and the person responsible. Once you have saved, your newly created module will be displayed in the list.

## Link activity

There are two ways to add an activity of the type **Teaching** to a module. You can simply click on the :heavy_plus_sign: in the panel of your learning module to go to the *Add activities* page. The *Teaching* type and the appropriate module have already been automatically selected here. Alternatively, you can go to the [Add activity](/users/creating-content/) page and select the type *teaching*. Here you have to search for your module by name or module number.

In addition to the module, you must specify further parameters:

- **Teaching category:** Here you can select the type of teaching activity. You can choose between *Lecture*, *Internship*, *Seminar* or various combinations of these
- Supervisor with SWS:** Enter one or more people who will supervise this teaching activity here. It is important to specify the *semester hours per week* and whether the person is affiliated with your institute
- Time span:** You can enter the dates for your module here. If it only takes one day, you can leave the last field empty. You also have a selection of semesters to the left, which you can click on to make it easier to fill in the time span

Courses can also be linked to [research areas](/users/topics/). The areas available for selection can be found at the bottom of the form.  

You can add several teaching activities to a module. The number of linked activities is displayed on the teaching module board (see above). You can display these in short form by clicking on the number.
