# Project statistics

On the project overview page, you will find a button that will take you to various statistics relating to projects for your organisation. On the statistics page, you can adjust the period to which the following tables and figures relate.

///caption
Here you can specify the year or key date for which you want the statistics to be created

Various tables and figures are then displayed for the selected report year. The tables show you, for example, the number of projects and applications for the various categories. You will also see a list of all cooperation partners and how many projects they are involved in at your institution.  
To illustrate the diversity of the cooperation partners, a plot of the types and a world map with the location of the partners is provided here. If you move your mouse over the plots, you can download them as .png files by clicking on the camera symbol.
