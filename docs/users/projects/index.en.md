# Introduction to projects

<!-- md:version 1.2.2 -->
<!-- md:feature -->

The project function allows you to document and manage your projects in all phases (Applied for, Approved, Rejected and Ongoing). You can also link projects to activities and keywords and add users.

If the Applications/Projects button is not displayed on the left-hand side of the menu, this function has not been activated by the administration or your user role has not been granted the rights for the functions. If you are missing something here, please contact your administrator.

If you have access to the admin area, you can customise the forms for your projects. Details can be found [here](/admins/content/projects/).

Here you can also set whether a project category must be created as a request or whether users can create projects directly.
