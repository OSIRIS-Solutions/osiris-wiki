# Link projects

As in other areas of OSIRIS, you can link projects with people involved, co-operation partners or activities.

## Link co-operation partners

If you want to add cooperation partners** to your project via the **:heavy_plus_sign: Cooperation partners** button, the following page will open:

There are various ways to add partners. You can use the [ROR-ID](https://ror.org/), search directly for the institute or add it manually. With the first two methods, OSIRIS fills in most of the fields automatically. If you add an institute manually, the following fields must be filled in:

- **Institute name**
- Role:** You have the choice between *Partner, Coordinator* and *Participant*.
- Type:** You also have a choice of terms here, depending on [ROR metadata](https://ror.readme.io/docs/ror-data-structure#types)
- Country code:** Type in the first letters of the country to select the country code

To display all your co-operation partners on a world map, you can also enter the exact coordinates of the partner institute here.

In future, the links to the institutions will be listed on the respective [organisation](/users/organisations/) page. In addition, institutions that you add manually here will be included in the list of organisations.

## Link activities

You can link your projects to registered activities in OSIRIS. If you go to **:heavy_plus_sign: Link activity**, a widget opens with which you can search for and select activities.  
However, the link can also be created via the activities page. If you select an activity, you can select the **:heavy_plus_sign: Link project** button on the page.

Here you can search for the available projects in OSIRIS and link them to the activity. Select the project, click on the button to the right (Add project) and confirm your selection.

## Add people

You can add people in different roles to both applications and projects. In both cases, you can enter additional people as applicants in the creation form. However, you can also edit the persons afterwards on the right under **Project employees**.

Here you can add more people to your application or project and assign them different roles
///

If you have added several people to your application and convert it into a project after approval, they will automatically be linked to the project. However, people who are subsequently added to the project will not be linked to the application retroactively.  
You can assign different roles to the people in the project from the drop-down menu. If you are missing a role, please contact your administration. They can adjust the [Vocabulary](/admins/content/vocabulary/) for project roles.  
You can also specify the organisational unit for which the persons in this project are active in the table on the right. If a person works in several departments or, for example, is a manager of a higher-level unit but is active in the project for a work group, you can adjust this accordingly in the table.
