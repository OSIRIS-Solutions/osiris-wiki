# Manage applications

Once you have created a new application, there are three different ways to manage it. You can see these by clicking on **Applied for** in the top right-hand corner.

:exclamation: Once you have changed the status of your application, you can no longer cancel it.

## Request rejected

If your application has been rejected, you can note this in OSIRIS and adjust the status.

![Application rejected](screenshots/application_rejected.png)
///caption
This page opens when you select **rejected**
///

Here you can enter the date of the rejection and a comment on the process. The overview of your application will expand to include another tab in red, under which you will find information about the rejection.

## Application withdrawn

You also have the option of filing a withdrawn application in OSIRIS. If you select **Withdrawn**, a form similar to that for a rejection will open, in which you can enter the date and the reason for the rejection.

## Application approved

If your application has been approved, you can adjust the status accordingly. As a few details often change after approval, selecting **Approved** will open a form in which you can adjust them.

///caption
Here you can change the title and start date of your application before saving it as approved
///

If you are missing any fields here, you can contact your administration, as they can customise the form.  

After you have customised the status, the page of your application will also change here.

///

You can edit the respective status by selecting either *Application* or *Approval* and then clicking on **Edit current status**.
As you can see, another button has been added to the left of this one, which you can use to convert your application into a project. Again, a form will open which can be customised by the administration. After you have saved, you will see a link to the newly created project.

![Link to project](screenshots/link_project.png)
///caption
Here you will find the link to the corresponding project
///

Your application will now also be listed under **Projects**. You can now link activities and cooperation partners on your project page. You can also find the direct link to the corresponding application here.

![Project page](screenshots/project_page.png)
///caption
Excerpt from the project page
///

This page shows you all the important details about your project, such as duration and time period. You can still edit these if anything changes.  

## Create sub-project

On the project page, you also have the option to create sub-projects. The form that opens when you click on **:heavy_plus_sign: Create sub-project** corresponds to that of the parent project category and is already partially filled out. Fields such as short title or project start and end are adjusted according to the parent project. However, you can also change these fields.  
Once you have saved your sub-project, it will be listed as an additional tile in the projects.

![Subproject tile](screenshots/project_subproject.png)
///caption

///

The subproject will be listed on the project page in the future, just as the parent project is shown on the subproject page.
