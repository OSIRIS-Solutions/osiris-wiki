# Create a new application or project

If your role has been assigned the rights to create new applications/projects, you can use both the **Applications** and the **Projects** button on the left-hand side of the menu and select **:heavy_plus_sign: Create new application** or **:heavy_plus_sign: Create new project**. You will always be shown all available project categories. If you select one of the categories, you will see whether you need to create an application first.

Projects for which no application is required beforehand are created directly as projects
///

For example, the project category *charity projects* must first be created as a request, the category *no request needed* is created directly as a project.  

Once you have selected one of the categories, a form with mandatory and optional fields will open. Once you have filled these in, you can create your request by saving it.

Via **Edit current status** you can edit the current status of the application - in this case *Applied for*.  

You can also **download** the application and save it as a Word or JSON file.  

You have the option to **delete** the application. Be aware that all links to people, activities or other information will be lost and this step cannot be undone. If the delete button is not displayed, you do not have the rights to delete applications or projects.  

If the application has been processed in its current status, this will be displayed under the **History** tab.

Under the **Documents** tab, you can add various documents to your application and thus make them available centrally for all parties involved.

As you can see, your project is also automatically added to [organisational units](/users/units/). This depends on the people who have been linked to the project.
