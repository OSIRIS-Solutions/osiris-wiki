# Reports

The basic aim of OSIRIS is to facilitate regular reporting of all kinds and to record research activities at the institute in a regular and standardised manner. As different types of reports are generated at an institute, individual **report templates** can be created in OSIRIS. In OSIRIS, this role is assigned to **editors** and **admins** by default. In order for these reports, especially the **quarterly reports**, to be possible, the entries must be checked regularly by the users at the institute. In OSIRIS, **statistics** on all activities are also created and visualised. These can be exported and used for institute reports, but also for personalised reports.  

However, it should also be mentioned that you do not need a template for every report. The [advanced search](/users/activities/advanced-search/) or the filter functions on the *All activities* page also enable a specific list of entries that can then be exported.
