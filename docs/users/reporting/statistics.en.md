# Statistics

If you are on the **All activities** page, you can access the **Statistics** via a button. Here OSIRIS offers you various tables that summarise the activities for the selected report period.

You will find the following statistics on this page:

- Activities in the report period: The number of activities per category and type are listed here. The entries must have at least one affiliated author to be included in these statistics
- Activities that started before the period: Here you will find a table with entries that started before the report period but ended during the period. This applies, for example, to courses or guests

- Statistics on publications: You can also get a more detailed listing for publications on this page, in which the entries are counted according to the different types.
