# Events in OSIRIS

OSIRIS can be used for the centralised management of upcoming conferences, congresses or other events. Events are a function that must be activated by the administration. If you cannot find a tab for events in the menu on the left and/or do not have the rights to add new events, please contact your administration.

## Create new event

To create a new event, you can either use the drop-down menu at the top left for **Add activity** or select the events page on the left in the menu and click on **:heavy_plus_sign: Add event**.

A form will open in which you must enter the following information:

- Short title of the event
- Type: You can choose between Local, National or International. The selection can be customised via [Vocabulary](/admins/content/vocabulary/)
- Date of the event
- Location of the event

You can also enter further details here, such as a longer title or a URL for the event.

If [Research areas](/users/topics/) or [Keywords](/users/content/keywords/) are activated in your instance, you can link your event to existing ones in the lower section of the form.

As you can see, you can of course edit or delete your event. To the right of the display shown here is the description you have entered or the longer title of the event.

## Participation in events

All OSIRIS users are shown the events entered on the right-hand side of the start page. By clicking on the **Interested** and **Participant** buttons, users can record their participation or interest in the event.

The number on the buttons shows you how many users have already registered their participation or interest. If you go to the event entry, you will also see the names of the people.

## Link an event to an activity

At the bottom of the event page, you have the option of linking the event to activities.

By clicking on **:heavy_plus_sign: Add contribution** you will be forwarded directly to the [Add activity](/users/content/create_content/) page. The activity type *lecture* is preselected here and already filled in appropriately for the event.
